		- all coroutines are executed in a single shared stack
		- contexts are backuped using exactly the par of stack used by the coroutine (top -> sp)
	- the event-driven engine is now never reenters
	- added the implementation of Web contents taxonomy support
		- in-flight segments are chained in memory
		- we store either the data buffer or a coroutine context for each in-flight segment
