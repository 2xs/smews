/* This module provides a simple dynamic memory allocator. Free blocs are

 * the size is required. Whatever the size argment, only multiple of

 * BE CAREFULL:
 * This memory allocator has been designed to be as small as possible, and
 * has to be used only inside the Smews kernel. It has to be used only
 * with corrects arguments (don't try to free non allocated data)
